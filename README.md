### Song Clustering

This is a setup to do basic clustering. Data is read from a database of songs.
The songs contain attributes *(loudness, danceability, energy, speechiness,
liveness, acousticness, instrumentalness)*. The songs are clustered using
KMeans, and visualized using a Dendrogram and a Dendrogram Heatmap.
